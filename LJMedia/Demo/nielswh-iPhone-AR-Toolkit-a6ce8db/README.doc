# iPhone Augmented Reality Toolkit#

## Overview ##

This version of the iPhone ARKit is a forked version of the ARKit started on GitHub by Zac White.  

### Goals of the project ###
* Not depended on a specific View Controller or the main App Delegate. (Completed)
* Ability to use both the Landscape and Portrait modes (Completed)
* Use CoreLocation coordinates and update location as the user moves around. (Completed.) 
* Use CoreData to store coordinates (Not yet implemented.)
* Ability to add different type of views to augment. (Completed 12/29/11.)
* Ability to touch any of the augment views to handle other tasks. (Completed.)
* Add a Radar Control (Not yet implemented)

iPhone ARKit's APIs are modeled after MapKit's. For an overview of MapKit, please read [the documentation](http://developer.apple.com/iphone/library/documentation/MapKit/Reference/MapKit_Framework_Reference/index.html) for more information.

## Current Status ##

* The AR kit is targeting the iOS5 SDK.  New features of the SDK include the following: 
* Using the AVFoundation instead of the UIViewImagePickerControler.
* AR View is no longer a ModalViewController but now loaded into a view. 
* Launches from a different view, and items are now clickable and will display their own View Controller.
* Improved perfomance.
* Many memory leaks seem to have been found.  If you see any please create an issue and I'll take a look.

## Current Issues ##
Removed the stacking feature that was added last month.  It was not fully baked and was causing more problems than it was solving.
